    "The goal of this project was to generate new song lyrics using a Markov chain, based on the lyrics of existing songs. I focused on identifying what have been defined as \"great\" songs, and generating lyrics from that to see if similarly great song lyrics could be produced. This project specifically gathered songs from [Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\"](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-151127/) list, published in 2003. I found this to be an important topic to explore, since many aspiring songwriters and composers could use randomly generated sample lyrics like these for inspiration or a jumping off point for their own projects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I used a language-based Markov chain in order to generate the song lyrics. Markov chains are mathematical systems that describe a sequence of events, which allows switching between states (which can include situations or sets of values). In terms of text generation, Markov chains can be used to identify which words follow others in a sequence, and can randomly choose words along this chain to generate a new text. I used both a first-order and second-order Markov chain in this project, in order to compare the results from each approach. The difference between these two models is that the first-order Markov chain only looks at the following word, while a second-order model looks at the next two words.  \n",

    "This project can successfully scrape lots of lyrics data from online lyrics websites, and can generate text based on these lyrics. There is room in the future to extend this project to focus more heavily on sentence structure and song structure when generating lyrics.\n"

    "There were two scraping processes I used to get the final data into a form I could analyze it.

Although the Rolling Stone website linked above contained both the song titles and artist names for 500 songs, I found that the website's structure was difficult to navigate, and therefore more difficult to scrape from. Luckily, this list is reprinted on several other websites, and I chose to scrape from [Dave Tompkins' music database](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~davet/music/list/Best9.html), which contains the 500 song titles, artist names, and other relevant pieces of information in a table format.  \n",

Additionally, a couple fully instrumental songs were included in Rolling Stone's list, which obviously do not have a relevant page in AZ Lyrics.

    "I think the most important insight from this project is shown by the differences in output for the first and second order Markov implementations. The first-order lyrics are much more original, since the second-order lyrics sometimes follow a bit too closely with the original lyrics. This could pose an ethical concern because of the possibility of plagiarism. If the generated lyrics are too close to the originals, or copy lines very closely, the original artist's work would have been plagiarized. One solution to this could be a function that compares the generated lyrics to the original lyrics and checks for similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I worked on this project, I learned a lot in the process, especially when working with Beautiful Soup and webpage scraping for the first time. First, I learned that making a large number of requests (like 500) from the same website at once looks like suspicious activity to certain websites. I lost access to AZ Lyrics several times due to the large number of requests I was making, until I requested a smaller number of pages at a time. I also found that when using Beautiful Soup, some websites are easier to navigate/get data from than others based on their HTML structure, which lead to the decision to scrape the list of songs from a website that was not the original Rolling Stone site. I also learned that although links for similar pages may seem to be formatted the same, there may be some discrepancies that can either be ignored or accounted for, and there are tradeoffs either way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I found that most parts of the implementation for this project were challenging to me, since I had not done such extensive web scraping before and I was unfamiliar with HTML structures. The process of downloading, cleaning, and storing the song data used a lot more steps than I had originally anticipated, and it was a challenge to reason through the process and get the data into a format that I could use. The second-order Markov chain implementation was also a challenge for me, given the additional complexity compared to the first-order version.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had more time, I would extend this project in a number of ways. I would want to explore generating lines with a certain sentence structure, and to incorporate song structure into the program. It would be interesting to analyze where songs repeat certain phrases or blocks of text (like a chorus) and add similar repetition in the generated lyrics to imitate a verse/chorus structure. Finally, I might also look at only songs for a particular artist or genre in order to possibly get better results. Although the list of songs I looked at was exntensive, there wasn't really any cohesive theme tying them together, so a more narrow range of lyric styles may produce better generated results."
