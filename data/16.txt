
Purple Haze all in my brain
Lately things just don't seem the same
Actin' funny but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple Haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
Oh no, oh

[Background voices:]
Hammering talkin' 'bout heart 'n' s-soul
I'm talking about hard stuff
If everybody's still around, fluff and ease, if
So far out my mind
Something's happening, something's happening

Yeah, Purple Haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You've got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time?

Oh help me
Ah yeah, purple haze
Oh, no oh help me
Tell me, baby, tell me
(Purple Haze!)
I can't go on like this
(Purple Haze!)
You're making me blow my mind, mama
(Purple Haze!)
No, no no, it's painful, baby
(Purple Haze!)
